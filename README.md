# Evaluating LLMs using turn-by-turn directions

This repo contains evals for LLMs, focused on turn-by-turn navigation.

This Github repo contains the code to run tests on different LLMs and evaluate the results. It does not contain the test sets itself, which are private for now.

More information, results, and the approach are available here: https://hansenq.substack.com/p/eval-llms-turn-by-turn-directions
